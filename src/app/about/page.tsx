          While trying out some <span style={{"color": "blue"}}><a href='https://medium.com/the-creative-founder/comparative-research-done-right-19710a81fe2b'>Adjacency Analyses</a></span> exercises while in <span style={{"color": "blue"}}><a href='https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/215'>Product Design Studio</a></span> at Berkeley&apos;s <span style={{"color": "blue"}}><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Berkeley_School_of_Information">School of Information</a></span>, I struggled to switch contexts when I needed to leave my design problem and look elsewhere for inspiration.
          And yes, despite the entire human corpus of knowledge at my fingertips, I spent most of the time staring at my screen and mentally checking out to this scene:
        </Text>
        <Image src={"/meme.gif"} alt='Spongebob Running Around Meme' width={480} height={360} />
        <Text fontSize={18}>
          I was wishing, no, pleading with my screen to just flash me some ideas. Just one word. Not asking for a lot (<span style={{"color": "blue"}}><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07107'>am I?</a></span>). Something to get my mind off of <i>picnics</i>. Any word. In big letters that fill the screen. And new ideas every time I press one button, preferably the biggest one on my keyboard. It would be like a tap of ideas.
        </Text>
        <Image src={"/snapshot.png"} alt='Snapshot of notepad' width={605} height={280} />
        <Text fontSize={18}>
          So I wrote it down, put all responsibilities and obligations aside, and let my debilitating habit of procrastination do the rest. So here you go MIMS&apos;25, I give you <span style={{"color": "blue"}}><i><Link href="/">ideas on tap</Link></i></span>.
